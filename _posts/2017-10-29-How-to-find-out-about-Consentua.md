Well reading this is a great start! So far our customers have been coming to us.  Sometimes via a soft introduction from a partner or direct after a search or having looked us up on a directory (we are on IAPP for example).   The common element, however, is that they all have a specific need which Consentua fulfills.  A need for a system/service (aka an API) to handle consent management.  

Yet this new consent management tool has to look good for customers.  It must deliver more than just a consent.  It needs to be transparent and give users some degree of control too.  

This new ‘consent management system’ ideally has to be delivered as a software-as-a-service in the cloud (with all the caveats expected of a freemium service), but also in a secure and low fuss way too.  

Typically, they require a method of creating an audit point that proves they as a data controller are allowed to process personal data.  They tend to want lots of flexibility.  This is because they know they will be changing the data types and purposes fairly regularly.  

They also have a need for a low impact, a quick and low-risk method of dealing with this.   Oh, and they do not have deep pockets either.    Which means Consentua’s great value and speedy enablement are massive bonus points.  

## What is Consentua?
It does one thing well. It captures consent to process personal data. With a clear, unambiguous description of the data types and purposes.    Along with the ability for the ongoing validation of this consent.  The clear user interface which captures the consent from the user is transformed into a standard based consent receipt.  

This consent receipt can then be shared and used by any party that the consent owner (the data controller) wishes.   This means both parties (the controller and processor) are covered when it comes to audit time and the question is asked: “has customer X consented to this use of their personal data?”  “Yes” is the response. “Here is the consent receipt.“

It is also secure, low impact in terms of the demands it has on customer systems.  Quick and easy to install via our plugins.    Also, the service is very flexible out of the box.  Consent templates drive the what the user sees on their mobile or browser.  Templates can be changed anytime.  Including, adding purposes, adding data types and new purpose groups, which could be due to a new product or 3rd party processor.    

## But can I see who has consented to what?
Of course.  A number of queries are available via the API.  These are:  What has this specific user consented to?  Who has consented to what for this consent service?  These queries can be sued to help with subject access requests, notification of a  breach and finally if a data subject demands the right to be forgotten.  

Consent services can be organisation wide, campaign-specific or even country level.  Yes, Consentua is international and can support any language as long as the translation is available,  the consent receipt is still created.  

 
## Trust & Transparency
It is not all about consent though.  One of the changes that GDPR brings is a demand for a more transparent description of the data types and purposes even when legitimate interest for processing this data is allowed.   A stretch ambition is to get apps to reduce the amount of clutter in terms and conditions.  This will hopefully mean apps use Consentua as the main vehicle for describing to the customer the service they can expect in return for sharing their personal data.   

Overall though the aim of Consentua is to improve the trust between customers and brands.  We believe that by having the transparent and easy to understand description of not only the types of personal data that are being used but why and for what purpose too; brands will increase trust.  This is because honesty that is then continually verified through practice and experience fosters trust.  But you have to explain what it is you are doing as a brand first.

## Widgets make it easy
In short, consider Consentua to be an essential service, but one of many that ensures your customers are happy.   We think of Consentua as like a CDN, but more useful.   Because of the consent receipt that Consentua stores are a record in your full control.   

Already mentioned, but the Consentua widgets which are growing in number, provide an easy way of integrating with the API.   They are available via this Consentua page.   Consentua is more a B2B system that a B2C consent capture mechanism.  As it is what you do with this consent to process personal data that will be the key to fantastic customer service.  

The widget is open source.   Please use as required and note Consentua can easily be a white label provided service if desired.
